# Raspberry Pi cluster computing project

The idea of many rpi's working together on one big project really entertains me.

I want to create a scalable network of a **server** and several **clients** to work together to complete a task such as **finding prime numbers** and computing steps in the **collatz conjecture**.

## Basic Concept

I know that I want the **server** to talk to many **clients** and distribute instructions and then collate the data that is returned from each **client**.
